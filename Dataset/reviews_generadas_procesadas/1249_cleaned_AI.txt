Title: Bulworth (2004)
Rank: 4
Cleaned Body:
Bulworth, the dark comedy from director Richard Donner, is a refreshing take on political corruption. Starring Chris Rock in the lead role of Washington D.C.'s mayor, the film offers a satirical peek into the world of politics. Chris Rock's portrayal of Washington is masterful â€“ he switches between a serious politician and an unapologetic hedonist with ease. The supporting cast is equally impressive, featuring gems such as Robin Williams as a campaign aide gone rogue, and Lance Carolla as a disillusioned aide who provides some much-needed humor. The film's screenplay by Scott Alexander and David S. Goodman is sharp and witty, constantly pushing the boundaries of what a comedy can achieve in the realm of political satire. Bulworth's blend of humor, social commentary, and clever storytelling makes it a standout comedy that continues to resonate with audiences nearly two decades later.
